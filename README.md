# Pawsome Animal Services

A full stack app for anyone running a small pet care business such as dog walking, or pet sitting. Users can log in to their account and set up individual profile pages for the pets they care for. Each profile allows users to upload a picture and save all relevant pet info such as name, breed, allergies, personality traits, service type and more.

**Link to project:** Coming soon! 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, EJS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Cloudinary for images, and Passport for Authentication

## Inspiration:

I realized then that an app to manage a pet care business would be a really useful tool, more practical than having it saved in the calendar or a notes app. This is the product of that, marketed towards people who want to start their own animal care business or those who are under the age of 18 and connot work in the workforce yet. 

## Optimizations:

- Add a calendar to sync appointments/services
- Business management page in the User's profile to track when they should receive payment and mark them received.
- Still need to add final pages such as "About" and some calendar functionality and appoitment/reminders.

## Lessons Learned:

This was the first project I've built using tailwind so there was a large learning curve up-front. After getting the basics down it becomes really intuative and super quick to make adjustments. Only downside for me is that it does clutter up the Html/EJS of the project. With some more time with it I'm sure that will go away.
