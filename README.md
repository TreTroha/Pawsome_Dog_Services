# Roverdex

A full stack app for anyone running a small pet care business such as dog walking, or pet sitting. Users can log in to their account and set up individual profile pages for the pets they care for. Each profile allows users to upload a picture and save all relevant pet info such as name, breed, allergies, personality traits, service type and more.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, EJS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Cloudinary for images, and Passport for Authentication

## Inspiration:

My son was having trouble job hunting this past summer. There were not many nearby that would hire under 18. So we were talking about jobs he could do on his own, such as mowing lawns or walking dogs. He asked what he was supposed to use to keep track of all of the pet info and times etc, and my first thought was just for him to put it in his calendar. I realized then that an app to manage a pet care business would be a really useful tool, more practical than having it saved in the calendar or a notes app.

**Name Inspiration:**
A combination of the name Rover and rolodex. RoverDex!

## Optimizations:

- Add a calendar to sync appointments/services
- Business management page in the User's profile to track when they should receive payment and mark them received.
- Still need to add final pages such as "About" and some calendar functionality and appoitment/reminders.

## Lessons Learned:
